    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Sean McIlvenny and am currently a student at Clark College. I live in Vancouver, WA and plan on transferring to WSU Vancouver. I am taking Javascript, Intro to C and Network fundamentals this quarter.</p>
    <h2>Why am I taking this class?</h2>
    <p>I am taking this class in order to become more fluent in coding and building websites with Javascript and overall just become more well rounded with my skill sets</p>
    <h2>Programming Skills</h2>
    <p>I dont have a ton of programming experience but have experience with...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>HTML/CSS</li>
            <li>Tiny bit of C</li>
            <li>Tiny bit of JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I enjoyed Python the most, but still had fun building web sites with HTML. I am taking both C and JavaScript this quarter to learn more about both.</p>
